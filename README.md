### Introduction
This project focus on designing a CPU on NI Multisim circuit simulator software
### Features
- Word size of CPU=5
- Supported ALU operations= NOT, ROR
- Number of registers=3
- Size of RAM=8
- Word size of RAM & ISA=16
#### Three modes of operation:
- 1. Register mode (NOT, ROR)
- 2. Immediate Mode (NOT, ROR)
- 3. Branching (JZ)
